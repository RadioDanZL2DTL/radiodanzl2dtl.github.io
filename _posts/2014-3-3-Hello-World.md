Hello World! Daniel ZL2DTL/ZL4YOTA here! I am one of New Zealand's youngest Amateur Radio operators and this is my blog. Here I will post my (mostly amateur radio related) thoughts and wonderings. My interests are of course anything radio or electronics related, 3D Printing and Arduino projects. 

Thanks for following me here! 

Daniel :)
